        My work has involved various projects centered on temporal and spatial simulations, with a particular focus on stochastic and physical phenomena. On this website, I will present several significant projects broadly covering the field of computational physics. We will explore the numerical resolution of various types of partial differential equations (PDEs) applied to a wide range of physical phenomena, as well as the use of Monte Carlo simulations for modeling both quantum and classical systems.

        In addition, I have a strong interest in machine learning. Consequently, I will showcase various projects in this field, ranging from biological applications to more physics-oriented topics, such as SIREN and LSTM networks. These projects will cover classical regression and classification problems, as well as more complex topics, including the study of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models.
