abstract: The processing of a neural signal can provide a wealth of information. Knowing which neuron is excited at a given moment, we can understand to a certain extent the language of our brain. The classification of neuronal signals is therefore a key area of neuroscience, enabling us to real-time analysis of cerebral information to trace the motor actions envisaged by the subject.
