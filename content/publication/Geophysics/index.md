abstract: We simulated the unstable convection processes unearthed by L.Collin in the second phase of the moon cooling using Dedalus. We unearthed a slow settling of the overturning circulation contradicting previous assumptions in the litterature and we justified that by a perturbation analysis of the governing equations. We also studied the consequences of the thermal profiles and the Raleigh in the strength of the overturning circulation.
