title: Short Pulse Reflectometry and Machine Learning

event: Swiss Plasma Center Seminar

location: Swiss Plasma Center, EPFL
address:
  city: Lausanne
  region: VD
  postcode: '1015'
  country: Switzerland

summary: Prediction of the density fluctuation level using
machine learning applied to the Short Pulse
Reflectometry data
abstract: 'This seminar is devoted to investigation of turbulence characteristics in the TCV tokamak using Short
Pulse Reflectometry diagnostic and Machine Learning approach, focusing on Trapped Electron Mode
(TEM) instabilities and their impact on radial transport. A 1D model initially provided insights, but a
2D model was developed to better account for curvature, incidence angle, and scattering effects. Using
extensive CUWA code simulations, datasets were generated for both Gaussian and power spectrum
turbulence structures accounting for various simulation parameters like the position of the cut-off the
structures of turbulences. The 2D model achieved R2 scores of 0.92 for Gaussian and 0.89 for power
spectrum tests, outperforming deeper neural networks. It effectively managed non-linear effects, delay
characteristics, and cut-off layer shifts.'
