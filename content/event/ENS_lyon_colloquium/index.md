summary: Numerical Investigation of Western Boundary Current Intensification in the Munk and Stommel Model

abstract: "Western intensification study started with the Stommel model and was later refined by Munk with the introduction of a harmonic viscosity term. These two models present a simple framework to understand the dynamics of the western boundary currents. However in some interesting regime they will not present the same physics. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences between the two models in the regime where the Munk model is not valid anymore. We will present the numerical results of the two models and discuss the differences in the physics of the two models."
